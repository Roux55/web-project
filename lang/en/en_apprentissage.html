            <h2 class="partie">A. Simplify and explain how to build it</h2>
            <p class="content">
                Initially, the main objective of learning the algorithmic lies in the ability to decompose a problem into simpler sub-problems. To do this, it is necessary to know how to explain and formalise one's reasoning. The goal is thus to know how to explain each of the actions to be carried out, without ambiguity.<br><br><br>
                The efficiency dimension of the algorithm should not be forgotten, so many questions need to be asked: how long will it take the algorithm to run completely? How much space will it take? Does the algorithm efficiently answer the problem?
                Indeed, several solutions are possible for the same problem.
                Finally, knowing how to go from the design of an algorithm to its implementation in a given programming language.<br><br><br> The confusion between program and algorithm is common: the algorithm is written literally (in French) and the program is written in a programming language. Whatever the form of our algorithm, we must never forget two points: an algorithm must be powerful and robust.</p>
            <h2 class="partie">B. Error and fault management</h2>
            <p class="content">
                Efficient because a poorly designed algorithm will lead to problems on several levels.
                The robustness of our program describes here its ability to maintain correct operation in the event of possible user errors.
                <br><br><br> We then study first basic notions, so that everyone is at the same level, and then specific things like the use of pre-existing functions, procedures and methods.
            </p>
            <h2 class="partie">C. A man-machine "interface" through language</h2>
            <p class="content">Then we learn how to structure an algorithm according to certain standards, both in the way we conceptualize it and in the way we write it. Once the algorithm is finished, we can transcribe it in the form of a program, in the given language.<br><br><br> Finally, we learn how to find, recognize and manage possible errors, in other words: debugging.
                The study of algorithms often means learning how to translate them into a program. <br>As said earlier, this is done using a programming language. This one is in fact a conventional notation with its syntactic rules and its system of instructions (C,C++,Java...).
